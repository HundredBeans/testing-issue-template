## Problem

To be provided by the product lead in a feature brief.  Includes Job-To-Be-Done and measures of success. 

## Proposal

The engineering team suggest solution, more of a general outline of the steps that will be taken to solve the problem

If possible propose two solutions

### Surface opportunities to pay technical debt if applicable (use judgment)

## Success criteria:

Define the criteria the team needs to meet to be successful.  Should probably include all verifications.   Mirror the testing plan.

## Mockups & Documentation
Anything of use to help shed light on the problem and solution.


## Phases (tasks)

The breakdown of the work that needs to be done. 

Each sub task should be clear and precise, more detailed than the proposal with steps that than any engineer can follow

List out components to be used and created, link dependencies on other issues, add order or steps to follow.

### Branching Strategy 

Explain the branching strategy that will be used for this project or portion of the project. (ie. feature branching)

### Test Plan

Outline the test plan for this project or portion of the project.

Define integration and end-to-end test cases

### Standard To-Do List:
- [ ] Implement Segment tracking (if required)
- [ ] Add feature flag (if required)
- [ ] Add Indexes for new queries (if required)
- [ ] When updating types check for usage in code base (if required)
- [ ] Contact ML group when adding new kinds or entity properties
- [ ] Ensure QA Plan(s) issue have been created ([example](https://github.com/nicejobinc/microservices/issues/4734)).  Could be 1 or many issues.


## Estimations

Break down of the time required for each phase of the project. Include any refactor costs (ie. js to ts conversion).  [Example Estimation Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sLre0miucU9CGsIoae4MrIhfy5duYySTb99olCBLz1Q/edit#gid=0)



## Uncertainties & Constraints

Questions for product, other engineering and management.  Any unknowns or potential blockers for work or things that might make development difficult.
